| Pizzeria Data Management and Visualization Project |

This repository contains my work on a project where I designed a relational database, conducted data wrangling, and created an integrated dashboard for a Pizzeria. The goal of this project was to efficiently manage, store, and visualize data to facilitate strategic planning.

| Database Design |

I leveraged data modeling techniques to design a relational database for managing and storing data. This involved creating tables and establishing relationships to facilitate efficient data storage and retrieval.

| Data Wrangling and SQL Queries |

The project involved extensive data wrangling to clean and prepare data for analysis. I developed custom SQL queries to manipulate and extract meaningful insights, improving the dataâ€™s usability for visualization.

| Dashboard Construction |

I constructed an integrated dashboard consolidating orders, inventory, and staff metrics into a single view. The dashboard features over 10 unique visualizations and provides a unified platform for strategic planning.

Feel free to explore the code and visualizations, and reach out if you have any questions or feedback.
